Backgrounding Notes

command + z puts the current running process in the background. It will give the number of the background process, like 1 if it's the first process put into the background, 2 if it's the second, etc. This number acts like an id.

'fg' brings the process which was last put in the background into the foreground. 

'fg 1' brings the process whose "id" is 1.

To implement this into my shell, I'd like to just have a type-and-enter command instead of command+z. Something like 'makebg' (make background).

When makebg is called, the current process' stdout will somehow just go nowhere instead of into the shell. 
Then, we can keep track of these background processes in some container, and when user enters 'fg [x]' we reestablish the connection between background process x's stdout and the terminal character output.
