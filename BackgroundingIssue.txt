Backgrounding issue
-------------------

I can't implement backgrounding with set_raw_mode(), because 
if I run a process that takes standard input, it won't read 
it, because the shell is reading it to make sure the user
inputted the suspend signal.

I therefore have to use the sigtstp_handler() approach I had in my 
last commit, but there's a weird bug. It runs perfectly the first
time I suspend a process, but then it never responds to ctrl + z
again. It just prints [^Z.



I tried resetting the signal of the process, but same issue. 
It works fine when it doesn't kill() the child process. Attached is the code of 
the test I ran. It correctly kill()s the child process, and then jumps to main2() 
(which just runs the main shell loop), where sigtstp_handler is reset. And it
still doesn't work.

I'm at my wits end...

It looks like I can't get backgrounding working.
